#README.md 

The project is a git tutorial on how to learn the process of usage
It follows a stepwise procedure of handling information from the basic
to the staging area. 
Ideally, I am still new to this but giving it my level best. 
I hope to improve and become better with time. 

I have made some improvement on using git/github, the sky is the limit, I can only get better in time.
I am looking forward to now uptading codes here
